## **Overview of Analysis**
Pewlett Hackward is a large company boasting several thousand employees annd its been around for a long time. As many of its employees will begin to retire shortly, the company is looking at the future in two ways that is by offering a retirement package for those who meet certain criteria and secondly by checking how many positions will befilled in the future. As a analyst, I have been asked by the company to provide the following deliverables so that the company can prepare well for the `silver tsunami`:
- The number of retiring employees per title
- The employees eligible for an mentorship program
- A written report on the employee database analysis

To easily visualize the relationship between the different tables, a Entity relationship Diagram was created

### Results
---
After completing the analyis, the retiring titles table was created to understand the total numbr of employees that will retire.
![Retiring temployees]()

* It can be seen that a lot of senior staff that is 25916 Senior Engineers and 24926 Senior Staff will be leaving the organisation. 
* Only 2 managers will retiring which is comparitively negligible as compared to other employees. 

Further analysis of the data was carried out to understand the number of employees who weree eligibile for mentorship and the following results were obtained: 
* In total `1549 employes` have been shortlisted after reviewing the data and carrying out the necessary analysis [Mentorship Eligibility](https://github.com/Manishthapa2022/Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis/blob/main/Data/mentorship_eligibilty.csv).
* The only major selection criiteria for the mentorship pprogramm has been that the employees should be born in 1965 and currently working with the company. NO other factors such as the time spent with the orgaanization, what level the employee is currently working at and time spent in the role has been taken into account. 

### Summary
---
Based on the above aalysis , it can be seen that in total 72458 employees are due to retire.

it can be seen that when we refer this table to the retiring titles tables not enough mentors are available to train the new employees. Also, ther are no manager level mentors available to train the new employees and for 24926 retiring senior staff, only 454 are available for the mentorship program.  

Also, furthr analysis was carried out wherein the employees from this table were further divided with repesct to their department to understand how many mentores per department. The below table was formed.
