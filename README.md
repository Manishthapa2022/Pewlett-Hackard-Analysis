## **Overview of Analysis**
Pewlett Hackward is a large company boasting several thousand employees annd its been around for a long time. As many of its employees will begin to retire shortly, the company is looking at the future in two ways that is by offering a retirement package for those who meet certain criteria and secondly by checking how many positions will befilled in the future. As a analyst, I have been asked by the company to provide the following deliverables so that the company can prepare well for the `silver tsunami`:
